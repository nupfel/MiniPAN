MiniPAN

MiniPan is a try to write a minimalistic replacement for the 'cpan' command
line tool mainly for the iPhone as limited resources make it impossible to use
it on that platform (cpan tries to load the whole package list into the memory,
even with CPAN::SQLite installed...

Currently only installation of single modules and their dependencies is
supported.


DEPENDENCIES

Of course you need Perl installed on your iPhone already.
There is a Perl 5.10.0 version for the iPhone OS 2.x in CoreDev's Cydia
repository. Installation instructions can be found on their page:
